# Infrastructure Provisioning

This lab will walk you through provisioning the compute instances required for running a single controller Kubernetes cluster. We'll need a total of 3 virtual (or physical) machines, which we'll be calling `controller0`, `worker0` and `worker1`.

Consult the Project Atomic [Quick Start Guide](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/quickstart/) for help getting up and running with three Atomic Hosts using vagrant, libvirt, virtualbox, bare metal, or some other virtualization host.

Note down the IP address for each of your machines.
